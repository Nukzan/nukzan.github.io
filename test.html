<p><strong><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_feminism" target = "_blank" title="Wikipedia definition"> Liberal feminism </a></strong> is an individualistic form of feminist theory, which focuses on women's ability to maintain their equality through their own actions and choices. Its emphasis is on making the legal and political rights of women equal to men. Liberal feminists argue that society holds the false belief that women are, by nature, less intellectually and physically capable than men; thus it tends to discriminate against women in the academy, the forum, and the marketplace. Liberal feminists believe that "female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women's entrance to and success in the so-called public world". They strive for sexual equality via political and legal reform.[1]
Liberal feminism is contrasted with radical feminism.</p>
